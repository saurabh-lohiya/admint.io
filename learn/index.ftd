-- lib.question-accordion: What is Web 3.0?

Web 3.0 is the next level of the internet, just like how you will go to high
school after finishing grade school. The first version of the internet is like
Web 1.0, where people just put up websites for others to read. But as the
internet grew, more things were added like videos, social media, and online
shopping. This is like Web 2.0, it’s more interactive and fun, but still needs
people to tell it what to do.

Web 3.0 is like having a robot helper that can do things for you online, like
finding the best videos or helping you buy things. It’s still being developed,
but it will make the internet even more helpful and fun to use. And this is
where Blockchain comes in, it’s like a special notebook where you can write
things down that everyone can see and trust, so the computers can talk to each
other and make decisions without needing people to tell them what to do. So,
it’s like the internet is growing and getting smarter, just like how you are
growing and learning new things as you go through school or life, in general.

-- lib.question-accordion: What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions across a
network of computers. Think of it as a way to keep track of things online, like
a digital notebook. Imagine you have a notebook and you want to share it with
your friends, but you don’t want them to change what you wrote. So, you give
them each a copy of the notebook and whenever you make a new entry, you tell
all of your friends and they add the same entry to their notebook. This way,
everyone has the same information and no one can change it without everyone
else knowing.

This could be a candy sharing game with your friends. You can use blockchain
like a digital notebook to keep track of how many candy you have and how many
candy you give to each friend. Each time you give candy to a friend or receive
candy from a friend, you add it to the notebook. This way, everyone knows how
many candy they have and no one can cheat by saying they gave or received more
candy than they actually did.

-- lib.question-accordion: What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual money that uses special
technology called blockchain to make sure that transactions are secure and
anonymous. It’s like using cash, but it’s all done online. Bitcoin is the most
well-known type of cryptocurrency, but there are many others as well.

To use cryptocurrency, you need a special digital wallet to store it in. You can
use this digital wallet to send and receive cryptocurrency just like you would
with cash or credit card. The transactions are recorded on a public ledger
called blockchain, which makes sure that the money is legitimate and no one is
cheating.

It’s also decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any government or
organization, so it gives users more control and autonomy over their money.
Cryptocurrency is still relatively new, and its value can fluctuate greatly, so
it’s important to do your research before investing.

-- lib.question-accordion: What is NFT?

An NFT, or non-fungible token, is a unique digital asset that is stored on a
blockchain. It is a type of digital asset that represents ownership of a
digital item, such as a piece of art, a video, a virtual land, or even a tweet.
Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are fungible, meaning that each
unit is interchangeable with any other unit, NFTs are unique and cannot be
replaced by another identical item.

NFTs can be created by anyone, it can be bought and sold on marketplaces like
OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare, and it can be stored in digital wallets. When
you own an NFT, you own a unique digital asset that can’t be replicated or
taken away. The ownership of the NFT is recorded on the blockchain. This allows
for transparency and security in the ownership and transfer of the NFT.

An NFT can be represented in various forms like a digital image, video, music,
3D models, virtual lands, tweets, etc. They can also be used to represent
in-game items, virtual real estate, and other unique digital assets.

As an example, imagine you are a digital artist and you want to sell a digital
painting you created. You could sell a copy of the image file to multiple
people, but with NFTs, you can create a unique token that represents ownership
of the original painting and sell it to only one person. That person would then
be the proud owner of the original digital painting and can prove it with the
token they own.

-- lib.question-accordion: What is Minting?

Minting in the context of NFTs refers to the process of creating a new
non-fungible token (NFT) and adding it to the blockchain. In simple terms, it’s
the process of creating a unique digital asset and making it available for
ownership.

In the process of mingting NFTs, you can represent an NFT by any digital image,
video, audio file, 3D model or any other type of digital content. Adding
metadata to the digital asset entails providing details about the asset’s name,
its creator, and any other relevant information that you want to include.

Minting is a key feature of NFTs, as it allows for the creation of unique
digital assets and the ability to prove ownership through the blockchain.

-- lib.question-accordion: What is Cypto Wallet?

A crypto wallet is a digital wallet that is used to store, send and receive
cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. It’s like a virtual
bank account that you use to manage your digital money. It’s similar to a
physical wallet that you carry around with you, but instead of cash and credit
cards, it holds digital currency.

A crypto wallet is also used to manage and store NFTs (non-fungible tokens),
which are unique digital assets that can represent anything from art to music
to videos. NFTs are stored on blockchain, and can be bought, sold, and traded
like other cryptocurrencies.

There are different types of crypto wallets, each with their own features and
security level. Some examples include software wallets, which are apps that you
download to your computer or mobile device, hardware wallets, which are
physical devices that store your cryptocurrency offline, and web wallets, which
are online wallets that you access through a website. Each has its own pros and
cons, and it’s important to choose one that is secure and suits your needs.

-- lib.question-accordion: What is Metaverse?

In relation to blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a metaverse is a
virtual world that is built and powered by blockchain technology and uses NFTs
to represent digital assets within the metaverse. In this context, a metaverse
is a decentralized and immersive digital space where users can interact with
each other, with digital assets, and with smart contracts in a trustless and
transparent way. The use of blockchain technology allows for secure and
transparent ownership and transfer of digital assets, as well as the ability to
create and execute smart contracts that govern the rules and interactions
within the metaverse. NFTs, on the other hand, allow for unique digital assets
to be created and owned by individuals, rather than just being a copy of a
digital asset, thus allowing for true digital ownership and scarcity within the
metaverse. This combination of blockchain technology and NFTs opens up new
possibilities for ownership, monetization, and experiences in the virtual
world.

-- lib.question-accordion: What is Web 3.0?

Entering a metaverse that is related to blockchain and non-fungible tokens
(NFTs) is similar to entering other types of metaverses, but there are a few
additional steps involved. Here is an overview of the process:

1. Choose a metaverse platform: There are several metaverse platforms that are
built on blockchain technology and use NFTs, such as Decentraland, Somnium
Space, and The Sandbox. Each platform has its own unique features and
characteristics, so you’ll want to research and choose one that aligns with
your interests and goals.

2. Create a wallet: To participate in a blockchain-based metaverse, you will
need to create a digital wallet to store your cryptocurrency and NFTs. There
are many different types of wallets available, such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet,
and Ledger. It is important to do your research and choose a reputable wallet
that has good security features.

3. Purchase cryptocurrency: You will need to purchase cryptocurrency, such as
Ethereum, to use in the metaverse. This can be done through a cryptocurrency
exchange, such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken.

4. Claim your land: In some blockchain-based metaverses, such as Decentraland,
users can purchase virtual land using cryptocurrency. This land can then be
used to build and host virtual experiences, such as games, galleries, or
shops.

5. Create and upload your NFTs: Some blockchain-based metaverses also allow you
to create and upload your own NFTs, such as digital art, 3D models, or other
digital assets.

6. Participate in the metaverse: Once you have your wallet set up,
cryptocurrency purchased, land claimed, and NFTs uploaded, you can start
participating in the metaverse. This can include exploring, building, and
socializing with other users, as well as participating in in-world activities
and events.

It’s important to note that the metaverse is a constantly evolving space and new
platforms, features, and integrations are being added all the time so it’s good
to keep an eye on the latest developments.

-- lib.question-accordion: What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a computer program that automatically executes the terms of
a contract when certain conditions are met. It is a way to digitally
facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.
Smart contracts are stored on a blockchain. This makes them secure,
transparent, and tamper-proof. Smart contracts can be used for a wide range of
applications, such as financial transactions, supply chain management, and
voting systems.
